### Exercise 1: Java Basics
Create a MxN table that can hold string values for each cells.  
The table should be read from an external text file.
The program should be able to accomplish the following:  

1.  String Search  
    Search the whole table for a given string. If a match is found, then display its occurrence in   
    that column together with its respective row and column.  

2.  Edit Cell  
    Edit the string value of the designated cell.  

3.  Reset Table  
    Reset the whole table by initially inquiring for the new size of the table, then generate a new  
    table based on the specified size with randomized strings for their value.  

4.  Print Table  
    Display the contents of the table.  

NOTE: All table manipulations should persist within the text file.
